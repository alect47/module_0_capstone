## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method is a piece of code that can be called on an object or argument.  It helps to save time rather then needing to type in the code every time you want to preform that action.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello()
  puts ''" Sam I am"''
end

hello()

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Alec")

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Alec")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

How can I make them more interactive and get more information from the user?
